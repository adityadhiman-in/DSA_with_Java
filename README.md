# DSA with Java

Welcome to **DSA with Java**, a curated collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in Java. This repository is built for students, developers, and enthusiasts who want to master the foundational concepts of computer science by diving deep into DSA. The repository will grow daily with new algorithms and techniques, making it an ever-evolving resource for learning and practicing DSA.

## Project Overview

This project is aimed at providing clear and efficient implementations of various data structures and algorithms, leveraging Java's capabilities. Each day, a new concept will be added, contributing to a comprehensive guide that can be used for both learning and interview preparation.

## What is DSA?

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are essential tools for solving problems in computer science. Whether it's managing data, optimizing performance, or solving complex problems, DSA plays a crucial role in ensuring efficient solutions. A solid grasp of DSA is key to writing optimized code and is a critical component of coding interviews.

## Current Implementations

### Recursion

Recursion involves solving a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems. It simplifies complex tasks by calling the same function with different arguments until a base condition is met.

- **Factorial.java**: Computes the factorial of a number using recursion.
- **Fibonacci.java**: Generates the nth Fibonacci number using recursive function calls.
- **PrintNumbers.java**: Recursively prints numbers from 1 to N.
- **SumNNumbers.java**: Calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to N using recursion.
- **XToPowerN.java**: Recursively computes X raised to the power of N.

### Sorting

Sorting algorithms are essential for organizing data efficiently. They reorder a list or array so that elements are arranged in a particular sequence, usually ascending or descending.

- **BubbleSort.java**: Implements Bubble Sort, a basic sorting algorithm that compares and swaps adjacent elements.
- **InsertionSort.java**: Implements Insertion Sort, a technique that builds the sorted list one element at a time.
- **SelectionSort.java**: Implements Selection Sort, where the smallest unsorted element is selected and swapped into the sorted portion of the list.

## Future Implementations

This repository will be updated daily with new algorithms and data structures. Here’s what’s coming next:

- **Advanced Sorting**: Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Binary Search, Linear Search.
- **Data Structures**: Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Heaps.
- **Graph Algorithms**: BFS (Breadth-First Search), DFS (Depth-First Search).
- **Dynamic Programming**: Fibonacci series, Knapsack problem, etc.
