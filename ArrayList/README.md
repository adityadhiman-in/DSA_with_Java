## Features

- **Declare ArrayLists:** ArrayLists for different data types (Integer, String, Float, Character).
- **Add Elements:** Add elements to the ArrayList.
- **Get Elements:** Access elements at specific positions.
- **Set Elements:** Modify elements in the ArrayList.
- **Delete Elements:** Remove elements from the ArrayList.
- **Size of ArrayList:** Retrieve the size of the ArrayList.
